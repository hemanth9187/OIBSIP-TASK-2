            <h1>The Hero of Indian Independence</h1>
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack, Odisha, India. He came from a middle-class family and displayed leadership qualities from an early age. Bose was deeply influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and was inspired to work for the freedom and upliftment of his fellow countrymen.</p>
            <p>He completed his education in England, where he studied at Cambridge University and qualified for the Indian Civil Service. However, his strong nationalist beliefs and desire for active participation in the freedom struggle led him to abandon a career in the civil service.</p>

        <h2>Freedom Struggle and INA</h2>
        <p>Bose became an active member of the Indian National Congress (INC) and rose through its ranks, advocating for complete independence from British rule. However, his differences with the Congress leadership, particularly regarding the approach to achieving independence, led him to form the Forward Bloc in 1939.</p>
        <p>During World War II, Bose sought international support for India's freedom struggle. He traveled to Germany and Japan, seeking assistance to free India from British colonial rule. In 1942, Bose formed the Indian National Army (INA) with the help of Japanese forces. The INA played a significant role in fighting against British forces in Southeast Asia.</p>
        
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Subhash Chandra Bose's unwavering determination and courage in the pursuit of Indian independence earned him the title of "Netaji" (Respected Leader) among his followers. His leadership and vision continue to inspire generations of Indians.</p>
        <p>Bose's legacy as a freedom fighter and nationalist leader remains significant in the history of India's struggle for independence. He emphasized the importance of unity and organized efforts in achieving freedom. His slogan, "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom," reflects his resolute commitment to the cause.</p>
        <p>While Bose's life was tragically cut short, his contributions to the freedom movement and his efforts to form the INA have left an indelible mark. His legacy serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by countless freedom fighters who dedicated their lives to the liberation of India.</p>
